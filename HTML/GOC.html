	<h1><a name="FG">First Generation</a></h1>
	<p>
	The first electronic computer was designed and built at the University of Pennsylvania based on vacuum tube technology. Vacuum tubes were used to perform logic operations and to store data. Generations of computers has been divided into five according to the development of technologies used to fabricate the processors, memories and I/O units. 
III Generation : 1965 – 75 
IV Generation : 1975 – 89 
V Generation : 1989 to present 
First Generation (1945 – 56)
ENIAC - Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator 
UNIVAC – Universal Automatic Computer IBM 701 
1)	Vacuum tubes were used – basic arithmetic operations took few milliseconds 
2)	Bulky 
3)	Consume more power with limited performance 
4)	High cost 
5)	Uses assembly language – to prepare programs. These were translated into machine level language for execution. 
6)	Mercury delay line memories and Electrostatic memories were used 
7)	Fixed point arithmetic was used 
8)	100 to 1000 fold increase in speed relative to the earlier mechanical and relay based electromechanical technology 
9)	Punched cards and paper tape were invented to feed programs and data and to get results. 
10)	Magnetic tape / magnetic drum were used as secondary memory 
11)	Mainly used for scientific computations.

	<h1><a name="SG">Second Generation</a></h1>
	<p>
		Second Generation(II Generation : 1956 – 66 )
(Manufacturers – IBM 7030, Digital Data Corporation’s PDP 1/5/8 Honeywell 400) 
1)	Transistors were used in place of vacuum tubes. (invented at AT&T Bell lab in 1947) 
2)	Small in size 
3)	Lesser power consumption and better performance 
4)	Lower cost 
5)	Magnetic ferrite core memories were used as main memory which is a random-access nonvolatile memory 
6)	Magnetic tapes and magnetic disks were used as secondary memory 
7)	Hardware for floating point arithmetic operations was developed. 
8)	Index registers were introduced which increased flexibility of programming. 
9)	High level languages such as FORTRAN, COBOL etc were used - Compilers were developed to translate the high-level program into corresponding assembly language program which was then translated into machine language. 
10)	Separate input-output processors were developed that could operate in parallel with CPU. 
11)	Punched cards continued during this period also. 
12)	1000 fold increase in speed. 
13)	Increasingly used in business, industry and commercial organizations for preparation of payroll, inventory control, marketing, production planning, research, scientific & engineering analysis and design etc.
